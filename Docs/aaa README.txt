README for Training App



This is the Windows version for Training App (please contact the administrator for OS X installation)



Using the Excecutable
- The excecutable can be found in dist > app > app.exe
- To run, double click app.exe. The first time running it may take a while


Running the code (Executable recommended)
- All code can be found in the root directory (where all the code is located)
- To run the code, you will need the Pandas and FPDF Python 3 modules installed through "PIP 3" (recommended to use a virtual environment)
- "cd" into the root directory (where all the code is located)
- Type "python3 app.py" into the command line

NOTE: Running the code does not work off of the same datasets as using the Excecutable. Therefore, data will not be synced when using the two different operation methods.
